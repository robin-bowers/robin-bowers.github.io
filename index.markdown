I’m a PhD student in the [CS Theory group](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I’m co-advised by [Dr. Bo Waggoner](https://www.bowaggoner.com/) and [Dr. Rafael Frongillo](https://raf.prof/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, particularly algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. I'm currently interested in matching markets, uncertainty of information, and information aggregation. I'm also interested in socially impactful algorithms and fairness in mechanism design.  

## News

My paper [Matching with Nested and Bundled Pandora Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08711) was accepted for publication at WINE'24!

I co-organized the [EC Gender Inclusion Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ecgiw/home) at EC in New Haven this year with Yeganeh Alimohammadi, Natalie Collina, Kate Donahue, Bailey Flanigan, and Maneesha Papireddygari.

I founded the [Algorithmic Fairness Reading Group](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1I34giRyqhKqOTpaFyXA0iEpjCagsZpB5?usp=sharing) at CU Boulder with Robby Green and [Mary Monroe](https://mfmonroe.github.io/) in Fall '23. 

I wrote a [guide to reading group orgainzation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMIdVBVf3o2abj_cYCc5OBPR7b1NEYg5a9ndxVi2kOA/edit?usp=sharing) for grad students (especially people in alg econ/CU Boulder). Hopefully it's of use!

I presented my work with Bo Waggoner on [High Welfare Matching Markets via Descending Price](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-48974-7_4) at WINE '23  in Shanghai in December.
