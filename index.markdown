I’m a 5th year PhD student in the [CS Theory group](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I’m co-advised by [Dr. Bo Waggoner](https://www.bowaggoner.com/) and [Dr. Rafael Frongillo](https://raf.prof/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, particularly algorithmic game theory and mechanism design. I'm currently interested in thinking about the value of information and designing algorithms with costly information discovery. I'm especially interested in socially impactful algorithms and fairness in mechanism design.

I helped found the CU [Algorithmic Fairness Reading Group](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/theory-reading-groups), and wrote a [guide to organizing a reading group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KMIdVBVf3o2abj_cYCc5OBPR7b1NEYg5a9ndxVi2kOA/edit?usp=sharing). 

## News

My paper [Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes via Utility Alignment: Unit-Demand Pricing and More](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20030) with Marius Garbea, Manolis Pountourakis, and Sam Taggart was accepted to FOCS'25!

I co-organized the [2025 Gender Inclusion Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ecgiw/home) at EC at Stanford this year with Natalie Collina, Mirah Shi, and Kunhe Wang.

I earned my Master's degree in December '24!

I attended the [Winter School on Data Economics](https://mcgt.um6p.ma/en/seminars-conferences/winter-days) in Rabat, Morocco with my advisor [Bo Waggoner](https://www.bowaggoner.com/) as a TA in January '25!

I co-organized the [EC Gender Inclusion Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ecgiw/home) at EC in New Haven this year with Yeganeh Alimohammadi, Natalie Collina, Kate Donahue, Bailey Flanigan, and Maneesha Papireddygari.
