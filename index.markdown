I’m a PhD student in the [CS Theory group](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/) at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I’m co-advised by [Dr. Bo Waggoner](https://www.bowaggoner.com/) and [Dr. Rafael Frongillo](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~raf/).


I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, particularly algorithmic game theory. My recent work has focused on mechanism design and information elicitation. 

## News

I presented a poster on [High Welfare Matching Markets via Descending Price](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02023) at the Simons Institute Workshop on Societal Considerations and Applications in October, 2022. 

## Works in Progress

I am currently working on "Wagering for Aggregation:" using wagering markets as a tool from which to aggregate individual agents' private information.
